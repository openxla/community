## This Repository 

OpenXLA is a community-driven, open source ML compiler ecosystem, using the best of XLA, MLIR, and IREE. The community repository stores documents used by the OpenXLA developer community:

* **[Governance](governance/GOVERNANCE.md)** - Operating processes for OpenXLA
* **[Community Meetings](https://github.com/openxla/community/tree/main/meetings)** - Schedule, agenda & minutes for public OpenXLA community meetings

## Other Resources
