# Welcome to the OpenXLA Community

## This Repository 

OpenXLA is a community-driven, open source ML compiler ecosystem, using the best of XLA, MLIR, and IREE. The community repository stores documents used by the OpenXLA developer community:

* **[Governance](governance/GOVERNANCE.md)** - Operating processes for OpenXLA
* **[Community Meetings](https://github.com/openxla/community/tree/main/meetings)** - Schedule, agenda & minutes for public OpenXLA community meetings

## Communication Channels 

* **[`openxla-discuss` Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/a/openxla.org/g/openxla-discuss)** - Technical and community conversations about the OpenXLA project & its components, community meeting invitations & agendas. This is our primary channel. 
* [`openxla-announce` Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/a/openxla.org/g/openxla-announce) - Less frequent announcements from OpenXLA project maintainers, including project news, events and major releases.
* [OpenXLA Discord](https://discord.gg/NNvMJ2yd7a) - Synchronous chat about top-level
project updates, and the development of `/xla` and `/stablehlo`.
* [IREE Discord](https://discord.gg/BexW7bgHqm) - Synchronous chat about the development of `/iree`.
