# Welcome to the OpenXLA Community

## This Repository 

OpenXLA is a community-driven, open source ML compiler ecosystem, using the best of XLA, MLIR, and IREE. The community repository stores documents used by the OpenXLA developer community:

* **[Governance](governance/GOVERNANCE.md)** - Operating processes for OpenXLA
* **[Community Meetings](https://github.com/openxla/community/tree/main/meetings)** - Schedule, agenda & minutes for public OpenXLA community meetings

## Other Resources

* [`openxla-discuss` Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/a/openxla.org/g/openxla-discuss) - Technical and community conversations about the OpenXLA project & its components, community meeting invitations & agendas.

## Repositories

* [StableHLO](https://github.com/openxla/stablehlo): Portability layer between ML frameworks and ML compilers.
* [XLA](https://github.com/openxla/xla): Main XLA codebase (being migrated from tensorflow/compiler/xla).
* [IREE](https://github.com/iree-org/iree): MLIR-based end-to-end compiler and runtime for ML models (being migrated from [iree-org](https://github.com/iree-org)). Note that IREE has its own comms channels (see its README).
